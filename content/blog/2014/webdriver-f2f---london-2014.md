title: WebDriver F2F - London 2014

Last week saw the latest face to face of the WebDriver Working Group held at Facebook. This meeting was important as this is hopefully the last face to face before we go to Last call allowing us to concentrate on issues that come up during last call.

This meeting was really useful as we were a number of discussions around the prose of the spec when it comes to conformance and usability of the spec, especially when given to implementors who have never worked on WebDriver.

The Agenda from the meeting can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebDriver/2014-July-F2F#Agenda)

The notable items that were discussed are:

* Merge getLocation and getSize to single call called getElementRect. This has been implemented in FirefoxDriver already
* Describe restrictions around localhost in security section
* How the conformance test will look (Microsoft have a huge raft tests they are cleaning up and getting ready to upstream!)
* Actions has been tweaked from the original straw man delivered by Mozilla, hopefully see the new version in the next few weeks.

To read what was discussed you can see the notes for [Monday](http://www.w3.org/2014/07/07-testing-minutes.html) and [Tuesday](http://www.w3.org/2014/07/08-testing-minutes.html).
