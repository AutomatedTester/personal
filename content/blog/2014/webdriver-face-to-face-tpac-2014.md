title: WebDriver Face To Face TPAC 2014
date: 2014-11-04

Last week was the 2014 W3C TPAC. For those that don't know, TPAC is a conference where a number of W3C working groups get together in the same venue. This allows for a great amount of discussions between groups and also allows people to see what is coming in the future of the web.

The WebDriver Working Group was part of TPAC this year, like previous years, and there was some really great discussions.

The main topics that were discussed were:

* We are going to be moving more discussions to the mailing list. This is to prevent people waiting for a Face to face to discuss things
* The Data model of how data is sent over the wire between the remote and local ends
* Attributes versus properties -This old chestnut
* An approach to moving some of the manual tests that are used for W3C specs to automated ones with WebDriver - This is exciting
