Last week saw the latest WebDriver F2F to work on the specification. We held the meeting at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington.

The agenda for the meeting was placed, as usual, on the [W3 Wiki](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebDriver/2016-July-F2F). We had quite a lot to discuss and, as always, was a very productive meeting.

The meeting notes are available for [Wednesday](https://www.w3.org/2016/07/13-webdriver-minutes.html) and [Thursday](https://www.w3.org/2016/07/14-webdriver-minutes.html). The most notable items are;

* Finalising Actions in the specification
* newSession
* Certificate handling on navigation
* Specification tests 

We also welcomed Apple to their first WG meeting. You may have missed it, but there is going to be a Safari Driver built in in macOS.
