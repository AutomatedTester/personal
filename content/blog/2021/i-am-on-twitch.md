At the end of 2020, I wanted to try something new, well new for the Selenium community. I created a new [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/automatedtester).

## Why?

The main reason is that I wanted to show people that working on Selenium is not scary. You don't need to be a "rockstar" engineer. Actually, Rockstars are actively discouraged since they normally just trash hotel rooms.

## What have I done so far?

I have shown people around the codebase. With Selenium being a [monorepo](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/monorepos/) which we do [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/). This can seem scary to some people seeing the code for the first time. I showed that it's not scary!

I also showed people how they can contribute to the [Selenium Documentation](https://github.com/seleniumhq/seleniumhq.github.io). Documentation is how a number of Selenium Core contributors got into the project as it is a definite pay it forward system, making sure that future Selenium users
have correct working examples.

And last week was about starting to remove all the python 2 specific code from the python part of the tree. This is not complete and, this week, I hope to work on it a bit more. I will be leaving the code base littered with TODO if anyone wanted to contribute.

## When

At the moment there is a session every Thursday at 2 PM GMT. Hopefully, as the UK comes out of lockdown, I will be able to add a few more sessions during a week. If you [subscribe to the channel](https://www.twitch.tv/automatedtester/) you will be updated as sessions change and be notified when a session has started. So please do subscribe! If you miss a session they are stored on Twitch for a couple weeks so you can always catch up later.

## Future Sessions

As we go through the year if you have ideas of things you want to see in a session, please let me know. My DMs on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/automatedtester) are open or feel free to add something to a session chat.
