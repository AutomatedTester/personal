    <p>Can you have an open and honest conversation with your peers and, this is the most important one, can you have an open and honest conversation with your manager?</p>
<p>Have a good think about this, don&rsquo;t answer straight away. Let&rsquo;s go through the following scenarios to find out if you can have open and honest conversations.</p>
<p>Can you&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="tell-your-manager-when-you-are-struggling-with-a-task-and-not-feel-like-you-are-going-to-chastised">
  Tell your manager when you are struggling with a task and not feel like you are going to chastised?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#tell-your-manager-when-you-are-struggling-with-a-task-and-not-feel-like-you-are-going-to-chastised">

<p>For me, as a manager and a technical lead, it is super important to help grow people. We all have times where we don&rsquo;t know something and no amount of searching the internet can fix it. Being able to go to your &ldquo;lead&rdquo; and say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do..&rdquo; is a good thing for everyone!</p>
<h2 id="tell-your-manager-when-you-are-being-harassed">
  Tell your manager when you are being harassed?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#tell-your-manager-when-you-are-being-harassed">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>This should be a given but if you were to ask a lot of your female colleagues, you will hear a resounding &ldquo;NO!&rdquo;. This has to do with company culture or &ldquo;not upsetting the 10x&rsquo;er&rdquo;. Even though it can cost a lost of money for a company if there is harassment, a lot of people just don&rsquo;t trust their manager to tell them about problems like this.</p>
<h2 id="tell-your-manager-that-they-are-wrong">
  Tell your manager that they are wrong
  <a class="heading-link" href="#tell-your-manager-that-they-are-wrong">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Feedback is hard to give and to accept. Especially in some cultures where it is seen as a weird thing. European culture is like that, you give a slight nod and that is it and anything more makes people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Now imagine getting critical feedback, it can be hard.</p>
<p>Now&hellip; imagine telling your manager that you think they are wrong and giving them feedback. This could be at a technical level or it could be at how they are as a manager. Expressing that feedback can be hard. Now&hellip; how does your manager take it. Do they get all defensive, do you get defensive.</p>
<p>If you answered No to any of the above, you really need to take the initiative and speak to your manager and tell them that you don&rsquo;t feel there is good opportunity for dialogue and you want to fix this. If they don&rsquo;t want to meet you half way to solve this then you don&rsquo;t need to feel bad that you want a new manager. This could be in a new company or within your company.</p>
<p>Honest and open conversations between your peers and your managers will create an amazing work environment and will allow everyone to succeed. It all starts from trust.</p>
