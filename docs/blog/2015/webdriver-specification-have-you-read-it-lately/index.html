      <h1>WebDriver Specification - Have you read it lately?</h1>
    </header>

    <p>A lot of work has gone into the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webdriver">WebDriver Specification</a> this year. The methods in there have had a major make over to make them more specific in the steps that are required as well as having the relevant links. Go have a read of it and feel free to raise bugs against it, we will be updating it quite regularly. You can see all the work that is happening on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webdriver">Github</a>. We do everything via <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webdriver/pulls">pull requests</a> so you can read things before they land.</p>
<p>My team have also been working hard at making sure that our implementation is following the specification and are making some great leaps with it. I will be releasing a development version of the python bindings soon that use the httpd, like InternetExplorerDriver and ChromeDriver, to drive the browser. Currently our httpd only works against Nightly but there is a merge to Aurora happening soon when we will be sending out links for you to start playing with it all. I am actually looking forward to some of the feedback that we get about it.</p>
