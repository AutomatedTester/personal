    <p>As many of you know I have recently released the 2nd edition of my Selenium book. When I wrote my first book I looked for a way to do version control of my book. Being a developer and test type, I used git to do all of my version control but I found that I would sometimes forget to commit and push my changes. This broke my own rule of keeping commits small.</p>
<p>The other problem is that if the text editor crashes, or even the OS crashes or I get a hard drive crash, there is a chance that I might only be able to go back to my last commit and push. Since I already said I am rubbish at doing the commit and push thing with documents git was definitely out of question.</p>
<p>I went to look for a different solution. I remembered that Dropbox keeps a history of files when syncing. So I went and tested the theory with a directory within my Dropbox folder. After a few times of playing with a file and syncing and reverting, I thought I would give it a go with my first chapter. I instantly fell in love with this approach. My publisher wanted me to use Microsoft Word to write all of chapters I instantly reverted to my old university habits of ctrl+s every few minutes. And every time I saved my chapter Dropbox would instantly synchronise the file and update the history of the file.</p>
<p>This meant that just by saving my file I was getting the small commit chunks I like without the worry of remembering to push my changes. I have lost the ability to do commit messages but in this scenario I honestly don&rsquo;t care. All I worry about is making sure I have the most up to date files I can if something were to go wrong.</p>
<p>I highly recommend people using Dropbox in this way.</p>
