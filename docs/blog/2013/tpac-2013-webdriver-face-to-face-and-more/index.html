      <h1>TPAC 2013 - WebDriver Face To Face and more</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Last week I was at <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/11/TPAC/">W3 TPAC</a> for week of face to face meeting to discuss WebDriver and other W3C specifications that other working groups are working on.</p>
<p>Our initial <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebDriver/2013-TPAC-F2F">agenda</a> went up just before the meeting and we were lucky enough to get through all the items. If you would like to read the notes for the meeting <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/11/11-testing-minutes.html">Monday</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/11/12-testing-minutes.html">Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>Highlights from the meeting are</p>
<ul>
<li>We are rescoping the specification to have the relevant things we need - we have been suffering from scope creep so we are removing things that aren&rsquo;t complete or won&rsquo;t be completed soon. We will be creating WebDriver &ldquo;Level 2&rdquo; specification which those features will go into.</li>
<li>We have roughly 36 weeks worth of work to get the spec and tests done. - I will be writing details on how anyone can help make this time line realistic so we hit all of our milestones!</li>
<li>We are going to be adding an API for when an element is intractable via mouse/touch, we haven&rsquo;t decided on a name yet but will be in the spec soon</li>
<li>Simon and I were speaking to other editors/working groups to see if we could offload definitions of things to them. It seemed to be positive, let&rsquo;s see where things head.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other actions from the meeting that need to be done but I think the items above cover the main points, at least for me, that came out of the meeting.</p>
<p>I found the rest of the week actually really useful from a networking perspective and from a learning perspective. I have a lot of changes that I need to put into the WebDriver spec and have been getting feed back about when i am doing it wrong which is great!</p>
