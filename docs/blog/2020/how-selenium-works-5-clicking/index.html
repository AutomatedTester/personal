      <h1>How Selenium Works: Episode 5 - clicking</h1>
    </header>

    <p>After an interaction on the last weekend of January 2020, on a Selenium Issue where someone said “why can’t you just…” after I explained the issue I thought that I would start explaining commands in Selenium WebDriver and why we landed on the design that we have today.</p>
<p>I will repeat this on every page of the series but a lot, an annoying amount sometimes, of thinking goes into how every little bit of Selenium works.</p>
<p>In this episode, we are going to look at what goes into clicking. For simplicity, we are only going to be looking at the work that goes into doing <code>element.click()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="you-have-an-element-you-want-to-click-now-what">You have an element you want to click, now what?</h2>
<p>So you have <a href="https://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2020/how-selenium-works-4-finding-elements/">found an element</a> and you need to click on it. Selenium will go through the following steps before it even does the click.</p>
<h3 id="check-element-is-still-on-the-page">Check Element is still on the page.</h3>
<p>When we were <a href="https://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2020/how-selenium-works-4-finding-elements/#what-happens-when-it-finds-the-element">finding an element</a> the browser would have returned a representation of that element. All subsequent calls to that element need to be checked that the element is still on the page. If it is not you will get a <code>StaleElementReferenceException</code>.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-element-is-visible">Check the element is visible</h3>
<p>Once we know the element is still on the page we need to make sure that the element <a href="https://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2020/how-selenium-works-3-isdiplayed/">is displayed</a>. This is important as we would never expect a user to click on an element that is not visible. Since a user would never click there we need to make sure that Selenium can&rsquo;t click here too. If it is not displayed you will receive an <code>ElementNotVisibleException</code>.</p>
<h3 id="scroll-to-the-element">Scroll to the element</h3>
<p>Next, we need to make sure that we can scroll to the element. To have all the events fire properly we are going to need to have the element in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport">viewport</a>. If the element is not in the viewport after trying to scroll to it, the browser will return a <code>ElementNotInteractableException</code>.</p>
<h3 id="check-if-the-element-is-interactable">Check if the element is interactable</h3>
<p>The browser will now check if the element that will receive clicks in the area that we&rsquo;re telling it is the same element as we have passed in. If it looks like it&rsquo;s not the element that will receive the click the browser will throw a <code>ElementClickInterceptedException</code>.</p>
<h3 id="firing-some-events-off">Firing some events off</h3>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready to fire off some events. We have a special case for <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> to make sure that it&rsquo;s parent element that receives the events.</p>
<p>We then calculate the centre of the element and start sending the events. You can read which events we send in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#element-click">WebDriver Specification</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-navigation">What about navigation?</h3>
<p>We need to tell the browser to watch for navigation happening thanks to the click. If a click does cause a navigation we apply the same logic if we were <a href="https://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2020/how-selenium-works-2-navigation/">navigating</a>.</p>
